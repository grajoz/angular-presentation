						In case that you are absolute beginners with Angular let me quickly explain to you what Angular is and

					<h6><span class="red">Angular </span> is a framework<br>
						for building client applications <br>in HTML, CSS,
						and JavaScript/Typescript </h6>
					<aside class="notes">
						Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML, CSS, and either JavaScript or a
						language like Typescript that compiles to JavaScript.
						Typescript is more common in Angular community because Angular itself has been written with Typescript.

					<h2>History</h2>
					<div >
						<p >2010 AngularJS (1.X)</p>
					</div>
					<div >
						<p >2016 Angular (2+)</p>

					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						AngularJS  introduced in 2010 as a javascript framework for building client applications.
						It gained popularity and angular team decided to rewrite the original framework using typescript and as a result Anglar 2 came out in mid 2016.
						This new version is entirely different from Angular 1 to the extent that you can think of it as a completely different framework.
						After it was made some updates  Angular team decided to drop the version suffix and simply call the framework angular.
						So now we have two kinds of angular.
						We have Angular JS which is the first generation of Angler written in javascript and is going to die sooner or later.
						And we also have angular which refers to angular 2 or later.

						<div><h3><span class="red">Benefits <br>of using <br>Angular</span></h3></div>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li > Gives our applications a clean structure</li>
								<li > Includes a lot of re-usable code</li>
								<li > Makes our applications more testable</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						So what are the benefits of using Angular?
						It gives our application a clear and loosely coupled structure that is easy to understand and easy to
						maintain.
						It also brings in a lot of utility code that we can reuse in various applications. Especially when
						dealing with the userâ€™s navigation and the browser history.
						Plus, applications build with Angular are more testable so we can easy write automated test to test
						various part of our application.

						<p class="red">Angular CLI</p>
						<p>Command-Line Interface</p>
						<pre><code>$ npm install -g @angular/cli</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							Then we will need an - Angular CLI
							It's a command line tool that we use to create a new angular project
						</aside>
					</section>
		
					<section>
						<p class="red">New project</p>
						<pre><code>$ ng new Angular-hello</code></pre>
						<img src="assets/hello-fin.jpg" alt="creating application process">
						<aside class="notes">
							Now we can create our project: ng new and the name of your project.
							So as you see this command generates files and folders for our project.

						<aside class="notes">
							Our project is successfully created now to start coding we need a code editor. You can use any
							editor which is familiar for you.

					<section data-background-image="assets/app.jpg">
						<aside class="notes">
							This is our first Angular app.

						<h2>Structure of Angular project</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Now it`s time to look at the structure of Angular project.
							Let's see what files and folders we have in this new project.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="assets/structure-main.jpg" data-background-size="500px">
						<aside class="notes">
							So the first folder we have here is e2e folder. And this is where we write end to end tests for our
							application.
							We have node modules and this is where you store all the third party libraries that our application
							may depend upon.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="assets/src.png" data-background-size="400px">
						<aside class="notes">
							We have the source folder and this is where we have the actual source code of our application.
							So we have this app folder here and inside this folder we have a module and a component.
							We have these assets folder where you store the static assets of our application.
							We have this environments folder and this is where we store configuration settings for different
							environments.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="assets/index-html.png" data-background-size="1100px">
						<aside class="notes">
							Also in source folder we have index.html file which contains our Angular application.
							So note here we don't have any references to a script or a stylesheet.
							These references will be dynamically inserted into this page. I will show you this a bit later.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Main file (main.ts)</p>
						<pre><code data-line-numbers>import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
							import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
							
							import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
							import { environment } from './environments/environment';
							
							if (environment.production) {
							enableProdMode();
							}
							platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
							.catch(err => console.error(err));</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							Also we have main file which is a typescript file and this is basically the starting point of our
							application.
							So all you're doing here is bootstrapping the main module of our application which is in this case
							app module.
							So angular loads this module and everything else starts from there.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="assets/src-diff.png" data-background-size="300px">
						<aside class="notes">
							We have this polyfills file which basically imports some scripts that are required for running
							angular.
							So this polyfills file is a gap between the features of javascript that angular needs and the
							features supported by the current browsers.
							We have styles.css and this is where we add the global styles for our application and also each page
							or each component can have its own styles.
							We have test.ts which is basically used for setting up more testing environments
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="assets/editconf.png" data-background-size="1200px">
						<aside class="notes">
							we have Editorconfig. So if you're working in a team environment you want to make sure that all
							developers in the team use the same settings in their editors. So this is where you store your
							settings.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="assets/lint-config.png" data-background-size="1150px">
						<aside class="notes">
							The other file here is TSconfig which has a bunch of settings for your typescript compiler. So your
							typescript compiler looks at the settings and based on the settings is going to compile your
							typescript code into javascript browsers can understand.
							We have TSlint. Jason which includes a number of settings for TSlint.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="assets/package-json.png" data-background-size="800px">
						<aside class="notes">
							Also we have an important file package.Jason.
							This is a standard file that every node project has apart from a bunch of basic settings here.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="assets/gitignore.png" data-background-size="1000px">
						<aside class="notes">
							Also our Angular project already have a git repository and of course  gitignore file is already there

							<div><h3><span class="red">Angular CLI<br>and webpack</span></h3></div>
							<div>
								<ul>
									<li > Combines all scripts and stylesheets in a
										bundles
									</li>
									<li > Automatically recompile application and
										refreshes
										bundles
									</li>
									<li > Refreshes browser<br> <em>(HMR: hot module
										replacement)</em></li>
									<li > Switch to native webpack <em>(command: $ ng
										eject)</em>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Angular CLI uses a tool called webpack.
							It gets all our scripts and stylesheets combines them with them in a bundle and then modifies that bundle. And this is for optimization.
							Now that aside what I want to note here is that whenever you change one of your files that file being a stylesheet type of file or an HTML file, webpack automatically recompile your application and refreshes your bundles.
